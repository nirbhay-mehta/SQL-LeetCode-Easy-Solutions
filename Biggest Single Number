SQL Schema
Table my_numbers contains many numbers in column num including duplicated ones.
Can you write a SQL query to find the biggest number, which only appears once.

+---+
|num|
+---+
| 8 |
| 8 |
| 3 |
| 3 |
| 1 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 | 
For the sample data above, your query should return the following result:
+---+
|num|
+---+
| 6 |
Note:
If there is no such number, just output null.

SOLUTION

# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT 
(
SELECT COALESCE(sub.num,null) as num1
FROM(
SELECT num,COUNT(num) AS occ
FROM my_numbers
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(num) = 1
ORDER BY 1 DESC
LIMIT 1) sub)as num
